# Basics Check

Create two double variables with the values `-20.2` and `14.5`.

Use `if` statements and the variables above to decide whether or not to print the following sentences:
- If -20.2 is less than 14.5, print `"-20.2 is less than 14.5"`, otherwise print `"14.5 is less than -20.2"`
- If 14.5 * -2 is greater than or equal to -20.2, print `"14.5 * -2 is greater than or equal to -20.2"`, otherwise print `"14.5 * -2 is less than -20.2"`

Please note that the only time you should be writing the numbers 15 and 30 is when you are creating the variables. The `if` statements and `print` statements should all use the variables, not the values themselves.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
