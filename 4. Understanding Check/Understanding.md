# Understanding Check

This will use the `Person` class defined in `Person.java`.

Create three people and save them to variables:
- Yourself
- A family member
- One of your friends

Use `if` statements to produce the following statements when appropriate:
- When your age is higher than your friend's age, print `"[myfullname] is older than [friendfullname]."`, otherwise print `"[friendfullname] is at least as old as [myfullname]."`
- When your family member's age is lower than your age, print `"[familyfullname] is younger than [myfullname]."`, otherwise print `"[familyfullname] is at least as old as [myfullname]."`
- When your age is the same as your friend's age, print `"[myfullname] is the same age as [friendfullname]."`, otherwise print `"[myfullname] and [friendfirstname] are different ages."`

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
