# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there are 2 `if-else` statements that are partially set up. Can you fix each of them so that they work properly?

When you are done, the following output should be produced by the file:

```
This is a sentence.
This is a third sentence.
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
