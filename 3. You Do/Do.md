# You Do

At Windsor High School, we have a retake policy for quizzes and other small assessments. The rule is that if you score below an 80%, you are eligible for a retake, to be able to get up to an 80%.

Make two variables for an earned score and the total points available on an assessment. Fill them in with temporary scores of your choosing for testing.

Make a variable where you calculate their score percentage as a decimal (i.e. 80% would be 0.8) for use in our conditional statement.

Using an `if-else` statement, check if their grade was less than 80%.
- If it is less than 80%, print out `"You scored __% and are eligible for a retake."`.
- If it is not less than 80%, print out `"You scored __% and are not eligible for a retake."`.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
